## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges

1. **Learning Curve**
   - **Risk:** Unfamiliar with pytest-homeassistant-custom-component
   - **Mitigation:** Use provided examples, reference official integrations

2. **Time Constraints**
   - **Risk:** 50 hours is significant investment
   - **Mitigation:** Implement in phases, prioritize critical tests first

3. **Mocking Complexity**
   - **Risk:** Complex WebSocket and async code hard to mock
   - **Mitigation:** Use provided fixtures, test incrementally

4. **Coverage Gaps**
   - **Risk:** Hard-to-test code paths
   - **Mitigation:** Refactor if needed, use `# pragma: no cover` sparingly

---

## Quick Start Guide

### Day 1: Get Started (2 hours)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-homeassistant-custom-component pytest-cov pytest-asyncio

# 2. Create test directory
mkdir -p tests/fixtures
touch tests/__init__.py tests/conftest.py tests/const.py

# 3. Copy example fixtures from EXAMPLE_TESTS.md
# (Copy conftest.py and const.py content)

# 4. Run first test
pytest tests/ -v

# 5. Check coverage
pytest --cov --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```
